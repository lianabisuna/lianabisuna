## More about me
You can check out the 8 projects I developed since 2018. I started programming when I was in first year college but got really passionate in my third year. I've also worked with 3 more projects during the 6 months in my first job. I'm looking for a job at the moment, you can contact me during weekdays. I value work-life-balance to avoid burnouts which happens a lot. Please reach out if you want to know more, I appreciate you for dropping by my github space!
